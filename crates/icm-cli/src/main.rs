## Persistent memory (ICM) — MANDATORY\n\
\n\
This project uses [ICM](https://github.com/rtk-ai/icm) for persistent memory across sessions.\n\
You MUST use it actively. Not optional.\n\
\n\
### Recall (before starting work)\n\
```bash\n\
icm recall \"query\"                        # search memories\n\
icm recall \"query\" -t \"topic-name\"        # filter by topic\n\
icm recall-context \"query\" --limit 5      # formatted for prompt injection\n\
```\n\
\n\
### Store — MANDATORY triggers\n\
You MUST call `icm store` when ANY of the following happens:\n\
1. **Error resolved** → `icm store -t errors-resolved -c \"description\" -i high -k \"keyword1,keyword2\"`\n\
2. **Architecture/design decision** → `icm store -t decisions-{project} -c \"description\" -i high`\n\
3. **User preference discovered** → `icm store -t preferences -c \"description\" -i critical`\n\
4. **Significant task completed** → `icm store -t context-{project} -c \"summary of work done\" -i high`\n\
5. **Conversation exceeds ~20 tool calls without a store** → store a progress summary\n\
\n\
Do this BEFORE responding to the user. Not after. Not later. Immediately.\n\
\n\
Do NOT store: trivial details, info already in this file, ephemeral state (build logs, git status).\n\
\n\
### Memoirs (permanent knowledge graphs)\n\
Use memoirs for durable, structured knowledge that outlasts individual memories.\n\
```bash\n\
icm memoir create -n \"my-memoir\" -d \"Description\"   # create knowledge container\n\
icm memoir add-concept -m \"my-memoir\" -n \"concept\" \\\n\
  -d \"Dense definition\" -l \"type:decision,domain:arch\" # add concept with labels\n\
icm memoir link -m \"my-memoir\" --from \"a\" --to \"b\" \\\n\
  -r depends-on                                        # link concepts (relations:\n\
                                                       # part-of, depends-on, related-to,\n\
                                                       # contradicts, refines,\n\

Target 3-10 pertinent stores total. Store the lesson, not the play-by-play. One fact per call, one sentence each, covering *what*, *why*, and *outcome*. Always pair a problem with its resolution if both happened this session; never store a gap alone. Anchor in VCS: prefer PR numbers and branch names. Feature-branch SHAs drift on amend; if you cite one, include the commit title so it stays grep-able.

This project uses ICM (Infinite Context Memory) for persistent memory. Usage is MANDATORY.

**Recall** — at the start of each task, search for relevant past context:
```bash
icm recall \"query\"
```

**Store** — you MUST store when any of these happens:
1. Error resolved → `icm store -t errors-resolved -c \"description\" -i high`
2. Architecture decision → `icm store -t decisions-{project} -c \"description\" -i high`
3. User preference discovered → `icm store -t preferences -c \"description\" -i critical`
4. Significant task completed → `icm store -t context-{project} -c \"summary\" -i high`
5. Conversation exceeds ~20 tool calls without a store → store progress summary

Do this BEFORE responding to the user. Not optional.
